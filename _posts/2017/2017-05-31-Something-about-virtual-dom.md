Virtual Dom is great! But, actually, I do think it's should be optimized by the browsers itself not some stuff like JS.

I do believe we just do what we should do, and leave others to the browsers.

Dang! [morphdom](https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom#benchmarks) what I exactly want is come out! Let's end virtual-dom!
